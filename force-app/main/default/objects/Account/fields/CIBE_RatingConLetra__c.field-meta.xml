    <inlineHelpText>The Rating provides an assessment of credit risk through a scale indicator (ranging from 0 -best- to 10 -worst-) that predicts the probability of default (delinquency of more than 90 days) in the next 12 months for current asset transactions.  The letter (from A -best- to F -worst-) indicates the risk segment, that is, the relative position of this customer with respect to the segment to which they belong (individual, self-employed, microenterprise, etc.).</inlineHelpText>
